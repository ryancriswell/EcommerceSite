-The top bar doesn't seem to be organized and takes up half of the screen 
-Big picture that shows the brand and what the point of the website is through visual
-A short summary of the sites purpose right on the home page
-Large pictures of the products though almost too big it is nice that it sorta fills the whole screen though
-The theme carries on through the whole site, though the downside of the big picutres is it tends to feel clunky
-A nice feature is the quick view where you can click on a product and look at some details without changing pages
-You're able to sign up at the bottom and the top and you get a pop up asking you sign up
-There are some nice moving images and fancy drop down text boxes sometimes a little much for me

-This one I like the simple navigation bar and logo it is nice and uniform not too clunky
-There is a search function that seems to work alright looking for included words
-Once again the opening page has a description of waht the company/site is for along with a picture.
-The nav bar scrolls with you while you scroll - I really like this feature
-Big pictures occupying space, sometimes trying to fill up all the space is worse then just having a small page
-After some scrolling the main page lists some of the products though they use a stock image for a host of products which is off putting
-The bottom of the page includes useless and too much information
