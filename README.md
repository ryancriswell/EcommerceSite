HTML Lads Ecommerce Site for CSCD 378

Currently our files are just HTML so to view you can just open locally in the browser. We have navigation in between pages via buttons so you'll only have to open one and you can navigate to the others inside the website. We are working on learning React which will help a lot in creating reusable components and we'll have to revise the HTML when we implement react, but for now we get the base layout of the site done.
