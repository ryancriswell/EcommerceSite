## Accessibility Features

The site currently implements a few accessibility features. On each page, pressing tab once when the page loads allows the user to skip to the main  content, skipping the navigation panel. The icons used for the search, user account, and cart provide additional information to a screen reader, allowing the icons to be read aloud as text. `prefers-reduced-motion` is implemented for the animations on the nav bar. `aria-hidden` is used on some decorative elements to prevent decorative elements from interfering with navigation by caret or audio.
